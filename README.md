# ShopyLie 📊

A modern, feature-rich product dashboard built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
_All the data, none of the truth!_

ShopyLie is a comprehensive dashboard for managing products, viewing analytics, and tracking orders, all powered by the **DummyJSON API**.  
It was built to demonstrate a modern frontend stack and best practices, including robust data management with **TanStack Query** and a polished UI using **shadcn/ui**.

## 🧠 Approach & Philosophy

The goal was to build a professional-grade, scalable frontend, not just meet assignment basics.  
Three guiding principles shaped the architecture:

1. **Server State is King**  
   All API interactions are handled exclusively by **TanStack Query**.  
   This centralizes fetching, caching, and mutations, keeping UI clean and snappy with background refetching and auto cache updates.

2. **Single Source of Truth for Data**  
   Data schemas are defined with **Zod**, and TypeScript types are inferred directly from them.  
   This ensures runtime validation and static typing stay in sync, eliminating entire categories of bugs.

3. **User Experience is a Feature**  
   Cmd+K command menu, toast notifications, and smooth page transitions were deliberately added to make the app modern, responsive, and enjoyable.
